This puzzle is a bit particular, in the sense that in order to solve it you must first understand what you're expected to do. This might be confusing at first, but that is intended.

At each turn, you are given 4 characters followed by several lines each containing a pair of integers. These numbers represent the coordinates of the game characters, including yours.

Find out what makes the game end and try to keep it running as long as possible.
