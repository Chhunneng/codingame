At the end of each game you obtain a score that depends on your movements. If you do not output any invalid action, you'll obtain at least a score of 2. Under certain conditions, you can be rewarded additional points.

Actions A, B, C, D and E allow you to move in the four directions or to hold still. If at the end of the game you have a score of 2, you can deduce that you did not succeed to move. Use this to determine what your coordinates are among the list of coordinates, then identify the meaning of the actions.
