# Bender - Episode 1

The goal here is similar to the **The Last Crusade - Episode 1** puzzle.
We have to print Bender's path in the maze and also be able to detect infinite loops.
We can detect loops by checking if Bender passed a cell twice in the same state and with no modifications to the map in between.
